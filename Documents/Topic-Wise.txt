Data type

Numberic value should be enclosed with single quotes(')
String Value should be enclosed with double quotes("")
Date and Time Variables should be enclosed with Hash symbol(#)

strvalue="asdsd" ==>string 
Number1=20' ==.Number1
Dtoday=#01/03/2022#

Time1=#11:37:24 PM#


Scope of variables

1.Dim
2.Public
3.Private

1.In out of function/class code DIm,public and private are equivalent.All declaration is going to apply to global scope

2.In function/Methods you can use DIm only.The declaration is going to apply to Func/Method-local scope
3.In a class definations, Dim and public declare variables that can be accessed for out-of class code;
private create variables that can be accessed from the class-code only.
private methods are callable from class-code only
public methods(default) can be called from outer space

private created variables that can be accessed from class-code only


constants
const

operators
1.arithmatic operators  +,-,*,/,%,^
2.Comparison operators  ==,<>,>,<,>=,<=
3.Logical or Relational operators  AND,OR,NOT,XOR (its is combination of NOT and OR operator)
4.Concatenation operators (& ,+)

Decision making statements

if statements
if else statements
if else if else statements
nested if
switch statements

select case <variable-name>
	case <case-number>
		'logic part
	case <case-number>
		'logic part
	case else
		'logic part
End select

create a program to perform all the arithmatic operations and take choice from user what he want to do

For <range or expression> Step <value>
	//Code
Next



write a program to print all odd and even number from 1-10

dynamic array

ReDim [preserve] varname(subscript)[,varname(subscript)]

preserve-optional parameter used to preserve the data in an existing array when you change the size of the 
last dimension
varname-a required parameter which denotes the name of variable
subscript-size of array

Procedures

Functions
Sub Procedures
	-do not return a value like a function
	-This can be called without using call keyword
	-Sub and end with End sub

passing a parameter into a procedure
	-ByVal=> the argument are set as byval then any change happens in the function to those arguments will not show any effect in the source
	-ByRef=>the argument are set as byval then any change happens in the function to those arguments then the same change will show in the source
